A random assortment of info.

On Linux:
To compile:
	cd <path>
	make
To play:
	./The_Game
Note:
	Where <path> is the path to the code. You'll need ncurses.
	
On Windows:
PDCurses is included.
You'll need gcc, I recommend downloading Code::Blocks, a project file is provided.
In C::B, open the project and click "Build".
If you use a different IDE, set up your linker to point to the PDCurses lib, then build.

==================

The_Game is horribly unbalanced. Don't expect any fairness.

After naming your character, you will get to choose a species. This
determines your starting stats, but doesn't have that big of an
impact on the game.

You'll then get to choose a class. This affects how your stats will
grow as you level up. Again, not much impact here.

All stats cap at ((2 ^ 63) - 1) / 10  (922,337,203,685,477,580).
Except Wait, which has a range of 100-9999.

Every level, your stats will improve based on your class, and you get
to choose a bonus.

Damage formula: (STR + ATK) - ((TOU + AP) / 2) = DMG
ATK = All weapons have an attack stat, which is added to your STR.
AP  = All armor has AP, which is added to your TOU, then divided by 2.
You can always do at least 1 damage.

Death is permanent!

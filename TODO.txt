Consider this as more of a wish-list of features than anything else.

Create a pop-up window for errors and debugging.

Make MAGIC_MAX auto-update.
 * Will probably have to change from a #define to a global const.

XP gain needs balancing.

Content and balancing! Very low priority for now.

Item descs wrap, but only on a letter by letter basis.
 * It would be preferable to wrap whole words.

Status effects that temp reduce stats. STR,DEF,MAG...?

Use game version to check savefile version.

Give the enemy an actual inventory.
 * Add an effect for displaying enemy inventoy, with stats.
 * Remove some info from the enemy's window, viewable when scanned. (AP, ATK, etc.)

Convert code to use GMP.
 * Or any other portable arbitrary precision library.

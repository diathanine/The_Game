Consider this as more of a wish-list of features than anything else.

Create a pop-up window for errors and debugging.
 * Also had an idea to use it for random events.

XP gain needs balancing.

Content and balancing! Very low priority for now.

Status effects that temp reduce stats. STR,DEF,MAG...?

Use game version to check savefile version.

Give the enemy an actual inventory.
 * Add an effect for displaying enemy inventory, with stats.
 * Remove some info from the enemy's window, viewable when scanned. (AP, ATK, etc.)

Skills need to be rewritten to be a part of the character struct.
 * Fighting skill should be a direct bonus to STR.
 * Similarly, casting and magic skills should add to MAG. 
 * I'm not sure about how the crafting skill should be modified, but anything would be better, really.
